#+TITLE: Posimacs Shortdocs

Supplement the built-in shortdocs with many functions that are distributed with
Emacs and could use cheat-sheets when forgetting related functions / variables.

License and all that on the way.  This is being maintained.  Just rushing it out
like this because it doesn't need complex CI.

*Please sign off on commits.  There is a DCO in here.  It might convince FSF to
cherry-pick the good ones without second thought.*
